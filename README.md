# DroneSimulator

Building a simple drone simulator, with telemetry tools and FastDDS pub/sub. 

How can we build a set of tools that allows anyone to become a drone developer without physical equipment? Our NYU Robotics Club has over 700 members spanning NYC Campuses in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Abu Dhabhi, Shanghai as well as cross-school collaboration 
with colleges in the New York City Metropoltian Area. A drone simulator development tool kits allows our developers across the globe to influence the work done throughout the semester.

The project uses Gazebo, AirSim, and FastDDS. Architecture to be published.
